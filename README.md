**Automated research aggregation for software leadership, innovation, and academic research**

> 🤖 **Vibecoded Project**: This project was developed through AI-assisted pair programming with Claude (Anthropic). The human provided requirements, domain expertise, and direction; Claude provided implementation, best practices, and code structure.

## 🎯 What This Is

A complete toolkit for automating research content discovery, aggregation, and organization. Designed for researchers, team leads, and knowledge workers who need to stay current across multiple sources.

**Single-command research digest:**
```bash
./research_digest.py
```

Automatically discovers, scrapes, and organizes content from:
- HackerNews discussions
- RSS feeds (blogs, journals)
- Reddit communities
- Twitter/X threads (manual curation)
- YouTube transcripts

**Output:** Organized by date, formatted for Obsidian, ready for NotebookLM analysis.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **10 specialized tools** - Each optimized for specific content sources
- **Automated orchestration** - One command to rule them all
- **Native tool integration** - Uses `pandoc` & `pdftotext` for quality
- **Obsidian-ready** - YAML frontmatter + auto-tagging
- **NotebookLM-ready** - Automatic file splitting at 400k char limit
- **Deduplication** - Smart duplicate removal by URL/title
- **Configurable** - YAML config for topics, sources, thresholds
- **Schedulable** - Cron/systemd examples included

---

## 🛠️ The Toolkit

The toolkit is composed of a central orchestrator, a set of scraper plugins, and several standalone utility tools.

### Orchestration
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `research_digest.py` | Runs the entire pipeline by loading and executing enabled scraper plugins. |

### Scraper Plugins (in `scrapers/` directory)
| Plugin | Source | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `ArxivScraper` | arXiv.org| Fetches scientific pre-prints based on keywords. |
| `HNScraper` | HackerNews | Fetches discussions based on keywords and score. |
| `RSSScraper` | RSS/Atom | Monitors blog and news feeds. |
| `RedditScraper` | Reddit | Fetches posts from specified subreddits. |

### Utility Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `web_scraper.py` | Manually scrape articles from web pages. |
| `youtube_transcript.py` | Manually download YouTube video transcripts. |
| `thread_reader.py` | Manually download Twitter/X threads. |
| `obsidian_prep.py` | Format any text content for Obsidian with auto-tagging. |
| `file_splitter.py` | Split large text files into smaller chunks for NotebookLM. |
| `file_converter.py` | Convert between document formats (e.g., PDF to text). |
| `convert_documents.sh`| A wrapper script for higher-quality native document conversion. |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Python packages
pip install --user -r requirements.txt

# Native tools (optional but recommended for quality)
sudo dnf install pandoc poppler-utils  # Fedora/RHEL
# or
sudo apt install pandoc poppler-utils  # Debian/Ubuntu
```

### 2. Configure Your Scrapers

Edit `research_config.yaml` to enable and configure your desired scrapers:

```yaml
# In research_config.yaml
scrapers:
  rss:
    enabled: true
    feeds:
      - url: "https://charity.wtf/feed/"
        name: "Charity Majors"
        tags: ["leadership"]
  hackernews:
    enabled: true
    search_topics: ["engineering culture"]
    min_points: 50
```

### 3. Run

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x *.py *.sh

# Run the digest
./research_digest.py

# Check results
cat research_digest/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/REPORT.md
```

### 4. Automate (Optional)

```bash
# Weekly digest every Monday at 9 AM
crontab -e

# Add this line:
0 9 * * 1 cd /path/to/Scripts && ./research_digest.py
```

## 💡 Example Workflow

### Weekly Research Digest

**Monday Morning (Automated):**
```bash
# Cron runs automatically
./research_digest.py

# Outputs to:
research_digest/2024-12-17/
├── raw/           # Original content
├── obsidian/      # Formatted & tagged
└── REPORT.md      # Summary
```

**Review:**
```bash
# Read summary
cat research_digest/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/REPORT.md

# Import to Obsidian
cp -r research_digest/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/obsidian/* \
      ~/Documents/Obsidian/Research/

# Upload to NotebookLM for analysis
# All files in obsidian/ are pre-formatted and split
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Design Philosophy

**Modular and Extensible**: The toolkit is designed around a plugin architecture. The core orchestrator dynamically loads and runs scraper plugins, making it easy to add new sources without modifying the main application.

**Hybrid Approach**: Uses the best tool for each job.
- **Python** for APIs, scraping, and orchestration logic.
- **Native tools** (`pandoc`, `pdftotext`) for high-quality document conversion.

### Pipeline

```
1. Discovery & Execution (research_digest.py)
   ├─ Loads `research_config.yaml`
   ├─ Discovers scraper plugins in `scrapers/`
   └─ Runs enabled plugins in sequence

2. Scraping (Plugins)
   ├─ Plugin (e.g., HNScraper) fetches content.
   ├─ Checks `research_digest_state.db` to see if item is new.
   ├─ If new, saves raw content to `research_digest/DATE/raw/`
   └─ Adds new item's ID to the database.

3. Processing (research_digest.py)
   ├─ Document Conversion (optional, uses native tools)
   ├─ Obsidian Formatting (`obsidian_prep.py`)
   └─ File Splitting (`file_splitter.py`)

4. Output
   ├─ Date-organized folders
   ├─ Clean, tagged markdown in `obsidian/`
   └─ Summary `REPORT.md`
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

**`research_config.yaml`** is the main configuration file. The new structure is organized around a central `scrapers` block.

Key sections:
- `scrapers`: Enable, disable, and configure each plugin (e.g., `hackernews`, `rss`).
- `topics`: Your research keywords for auto-tagging.
- `processing`: Enable features like auto-tagging and file splitting.

See [AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md](AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed configuration options.
